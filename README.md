Puzzle #2: The Food Dictator
Small teams of people who work together often have a tough time figuring out where to go for lunch. If you use consensus, this creates a least-common-denominator solution, very boring.  However, an elected Food Dictator is often more bold and creative in decreeing the lunch spot of the day.  

Create a simple app/webapp that you can use to persist and manage a list of people who regularly go out to lunch together. The main function of the app is to provide a way for the group to determine the “food dictator” -- the person who gets to decide where to go for lunch -- in a fair and equitable manner, given the people who are present for lunch on that day.
